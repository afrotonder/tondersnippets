# Open/close toggle for facebook feed plugin 

Facebook allows users to embed their facebook page feed right in your website by adding
a script that calls the facebook api and retrieves your page info. 

This plugin is simple and is meant to be somewhere staticaly placed. I needed the feed to appear at the bottom 
left corner of the website and also have the option to hide/re-open it when clicking a button. That need became this directory.

# How it currenly looks

![feed closed](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ZE2eh4fDCMfX7ockdJkOwntJdOAQrL8v) 

## Files in directory

The files in this directory are fb-feed-styles.css, fb-feed-toggle.html, & fb-feed-header-scipt.html.
