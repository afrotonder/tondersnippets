# Open/close toggle for facebook feed plugin 

Facebook allows users to embed their facebook page feed right in your website by adding
a script that calls the facebook api and retrieves your page info. 

This plugin is simple and is meant to be somewhere staticaly placed. I needed the feed to appear at the bottom 
left corner of the website and also have the option to hide/re-open it when clicking a button. That need became this directory.

# How it currenly looks

![toggle open](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZE2eh4fDCMfX7ockdJkOwntJdOAQrL8v/view?usp=sharing)
![toggle closed]()
![toggle open-hover]()

The files in this directory are fb-feed-styles.css, fb-feed-toggle.html, & fb-feed-header-scipt.html.
